	<!-- Importance of Reducing Food Waste -->
	<h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Reducing Food Waste Matters</h2>
	<p class="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
		Food waste is a significant global challenge, contributing to environmental, economic, and social issues. Did you know:
	</p>
	<ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
		<li>
			Nearly one-third of all food produced globally goes to waste
			(<a href="https://www.fao.org/3/i3347e/i3347e.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-green-600 underline">FAO Report</a>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Food waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions
			(<a href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/unep-food-waste-index-report-2021" target="_blank" class="text-green-600 underline">UNEP Food Waste Index</a>).
		</li>
		<li>
			Reducing food waste is one of the most effective ways to combat climate change
			(<a href="https://www.drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste" target="_blank" class="text-green-600 underline">Project Drawdown</a>).
		</li>
